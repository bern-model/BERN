A fuzzy logic based model for plant community habitat predictation. The model has been implemented in multiple languages, 
this version is written as a C++ library. A demo main function is provided and a [SWIG](www.swig.org) wrapper for Python.

## Abstract

The BERN model (Bioindication for Ecosystem Regeneration towards Natural conditions) 
was developed to integrate ecological cause-effect relationships into studies on environmental 
status assessment and forecasting. Qualitative knowledge on the relationship between site types 
and vegetation communities is widely available, as can be seen from the extensive phytosociological 
publications. The aim of the BERN model is to make part of this knowledge available in numerical 
form for computer-based ecosystem modelling. The task of the BERN database is to document reference 
data for the occurrence of plant species in competitive equilibrium with each other and in equilibrium 
with the site factors. The BERN model combines the fundamental species niches that mainly form the 
competitively stable structure of a natural plant community in order to determine the realised multifactorial 
niche of this community. This is the decisive innovation compared to existing dynamic vegetation models. 
The methodology of creating the BERN database and the BERN model will be documented and possible applications 
are demonstrated with examples. One of the examples is the determination of the current regeneration potential 
of NATURA 2000 habitats.

## Installation

The BERN-library as well as the demo main function is build with CMAKE without any special needs for configuration. 
Installtion on Linux (needs a C++ compier as well as a CMAKE)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.sh
cmake . build/
cd build
make
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building the Python extension works on Linux with installed python-dev package and a C++ compiler

~~~~~~~~~~~~~.sh
python setup.py build_ext build_py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/*.whl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows this works basically in the same manner if the MSVC-Compiler fitting to your Python version 
is installed and the commands above are issued in a Microsoft-SDK prompt.
